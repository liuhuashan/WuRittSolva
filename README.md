# WuRittSolva

@20050824

WuRittSolva is a standard application package for computer algebra system Mathematica(TM) developped by Liu Hua-Shan for mechanization mathematics education purpose at present. It introduces the Wu-Ritt Well-Order Principle and Zero-Decompostion Theorem as its key theory considering points, and has implemented the most operation for normal polynomials processing, such as fixing CLASS, MAIN VARIABLE, SEPARANT, POLYNOMIAL RANK, BASIC SET, CHARACTERISTIC SET and so on. What is more, it supplies smart functions for elementary geometry theorems proving, promising theorem proving in a smart way.

It strongly advizes that the polynomials appearing for functions in WuRittSolva are belong to polynomial ring K[u_1,u_2,...,u_n;x_1,x_2,...,x_n] such that the results may be more perfect for understanding.

This work is mainly for educational purposes, for the use of the WuRitt characteristic set method.

Up to now, the main components in mechanzation mathematics that have been implemented in WuRittSolva are only the basic algorithms of characteristic set method and also simple geometry theorem proving functions. This package WuRittSolva, however, shall introduce more algorithms for relevant subjects, including algebraic varities, simplifying, PDEs reducing, algebraic curves and surfaces, and differential characteristic set methods with corresponding objects.
